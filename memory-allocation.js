// primitive data types are always immutable (assigned to unique place in memory)
// when we run the code with node, the variable age is allocated to computer memory
// this means that it has its own unique place in memory

// let age = 25
// age = 30

// console.log(age)

// non-primitive data types

let numbersArray = [1, 66, 33, 7]
numbersArray = [567]
console.log(numbersArray)
